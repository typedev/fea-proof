# OpenType Features Proof

A web tool that shows what a font's OpenType features actually do — on **real words**.

Drop a font (`.otf` / `.ttf` / `.woff` / `.woff2`) and it introspects the font's
GSUB/GPOS features, works out which glyphs each feature affects, and renders a
**before / after** proof for every feature using realistic sample text in the
right language.

**Everything runs in your browser.** Fonts are never uploaded — parsing,
analysis and rendering all happen client-side, so licensed fonts stay on your
machine.

## What it shows

- **Feature list** — every GSUB/GPOS feature with its human-readable name, lookup
  kind, default-on/off state, and the scripts & language systems it's registered
  under.
- **Single substitutions** (`smcp`, `onum`, `ssXX`, `cvXX`, `case`, positional
  `init`/`fina`/`isol`, …) proofed on living words picked from frequency
  wordlists, with the affected glyphs highlighted.
- **Ligatures** (`liga`, `dlig`, `hlig`, …) shown inside real words, with standard
  ligatures isolated so you see exactly what each feature adds.
- **Localized forms** (`locl`) broken out **per language** (via
  `font-language-override` + `lang`), e.g. Serbian/Bulgarian Cyrillic, classical
  Latin, etc.
- **Contextual features** (`calt`, context-driven swashes) — trigger text is
  derived analytically from the lookups and confirmed by shaping.
- **Figures** (`onum`/`lnum`/`tnum`/`pnum`/`frac`/`zero`…) on numeric templates.
- **Full glyph inventory** — for features that touch many glyphs (small caps over
  whole alphabets), a "Show all N affected glyphs" grid grouped by script.
- **Feature combinations** — base glyphs touched by several features get
  interactive toggles so you can stack them and see how they combine (applied in
  the font's correct LookupList order by the browser shaper).
- **Alternates** (`aalt`, `salt`) — a grid of every glyph's alternate forms.
- Adjustable preview size and a light/dark theme.

Scripts covered for sample generation: **Latin, Cyrillic, Greek** (the
architecture is pluggable for more).

## Run locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # Vite dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # type-check + production build
npm run test     # Vitest (unit tests)
```

Drop your own fonts onto the page. For local testing you can put fonts in
`test_fonts/` (git-ignored — see `test_fonts/README.md`); the dev server serves
them at `/test_fonts/<file>`.

## How it works

- **Parsing:** [`opentype.js`](https://github.com/opentypejs/opentype.js) reads
  the sfnt tables. WOFF2 is decoded to sfnt with
  [`woff2-encoder`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/woff2-encoder); WOFF1/OTF/TTF
  are read natively.
- **Rendering:** previews use the browser's own shaper — the font is registered
  as a `FontFace` and rendered with CSS `font-feature-settings` /
  `font-language-override`. This gives correct shaping (and complex-script / RTL
  support in future) for free.
- **Sample text:** affected input glyphs are mapped back to Unicode via the
  inverted cmap, then real words containing those characters are chosen from
  bundled frequency wordlists (lazy-loaded per script).
- **Analysis:** [HarfBuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzzjs) (wasm, lazy
  loaded) is used as an analysis engine — not a renderer — to diff shaping
  before/after a feature (exact changed glyphs to highlight) and to confirm
  contextual triggers.

## Tech

React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4. No backend.

## Data & licensing

- Sample wordlists in `src/samples/wordlists/` are derived from
  [FrequencyWords](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords) (Hermit Dave,
  MIT) — top entries per language, filtered by script.
- Test fonts are **not** committed.
- Code is MIT-licensed.

## Roadmap

- True cross-feature cascade detection via shaping (the combinations explorer
  already covers most of this).
- More scripts (Arabic, Devanagari, Hebrew — the browser already shapes them; the
  work is sample generation and UI).
- Visual design pass.
